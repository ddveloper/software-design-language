# SDL Spec Governance
#
# Changes to the language specification require explicit approval from spec maintainers.
# This gate applies regardless of who opens the PR.
#
# To add a reviewer, append their GitHub handle to the /spec and /stdlib lines.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Spec and stdlib require designated reviewer approval
/spec/     @ddveloper
/stdlib/   @ddveloper

# Docs changes are lower friction but still tracked
/docs/     @ddveloper
